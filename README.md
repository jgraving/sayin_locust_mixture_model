# Bimodal Von Mises Mixture Model for Locust Directional Preferences

This repository contains a **bimodal von Mises mixture model** used to test the directional preferences of individual locusts in response to virtual swarms of conspecifics in **virtual reality (VR)**, as described in **[Sayin et al., Placeholder Year]**.

## Description

The model was developed to:

- Test hypotheses about locust directional preferences.
- Fit a **bimodal von Mises mixture model** to the directional data.
- Provide probabilistic estimates of individual and population-level trends.
